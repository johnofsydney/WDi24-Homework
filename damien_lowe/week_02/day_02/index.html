        <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Linus Benedict Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. His parents are Anna and Nils Torvalds, both of whom are journalists.
          He is the grandson of the Finnish-Swedish journalist and poet, Ole Torvalds. Between 1988 and 1996, he studied at the University of Helsinki,
          from where he obtained a master’s degree in computer science and was a part of the NODES research group.
          During his period of study, he became a part of the Finnish Army and attended an eleven month training programme in order to meet the compulsory
          military service criteria of Finland, interrupting his studies. While in the army, he reached the position of a second lieutenant.
          In 1990, he went back to university to continue his studies.
          It was during this time that he got acquainted with the operating system, ‘Unix’.
          He wrote his Master’s thesis on ‘Linux: A Portable Operating System'. He became fascinated and deeply interested in computer science
          and programmed assembly languages, text editors and a few games.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          In 1991, he purchased the Intel 80386-based IBM PC and obtained a MINIX operating system. With this, he began to work and research on the Linux operating system.
          In 1996, he went on a visit to the technology firm, ‘Transmeta’, where he began to work from the following year. He later worked for the Open Source Development
          Labs. From 1997 to 1999, he worked on the '86open' project, which is a binary file format for the ‘Unix’ and Unix-like operating systems, which were to be used on
          a common x86 PC. n 1999, he was offered stock options for his creation by the companies, Red Hat and VA Linux. That very year, the stock prices increased to about
          $20 million after the companies went public. In June 2004, along with his family, he relocated to Beaverton, Oregon, where Open Source Development Labs was headquartered.
          The following year, he developed the software, ‘Git’. By 2006, about two per cent of the Linux kernel was written by him, which was a significant contribution.
          In 2012, he stated that his contribution to the Linux kernel mostly involved merging codes that were already written by others and did not involve much programming.

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          Nowadays, Torvalds combines his working life with his family life. He got married to longtime sweetheart Tove Monni, whom he met in 1993. Torvalds was running introductory computer classes at the time and had asked his students to send him an email as a test. Tove, who was one of the students, sent him an email asking for a date.
          He accepted, and three years later, in 1996, the first of their three daughters was born.
          In her younger days, Tove was crowned national karate champion of Finland no fewer than six times. She took Torvalds’s family name and now Mr. and Mrs. Torvalds have three children, all girls.
          Although Tove had moved to the US to be with her husband, the couple wanted more peaceful surroundings to bring up their young children. So they decided to move to a quieter location in 2004, opting for Portland, Oregon. “We want to be somewhere calmer and saner. Silicon Valley is a bit crazy,” said Torvalds.

        <h2>Awards & Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Named by Time magazine as the ‘one of the most influential people in the world’, Linus Torvalds is the creative genius behind the Linux kernel operating system.
          He wrote it as a part of his Master’s thesis titled, ‘Linux: A Portable Operating System' at the young age of 21.
          Listed in The Britannica Guide's 'The 100 Most Influential Inventors of All Time', he is also listed 17th on the Time magazines poll
          of ‘Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century'. He is one of the world’s most renowned software programmers, who revolutionised the computer industry.
          He even has an asteroid and an asteroid moon named after him. He is the owner of the Linux trademark and is one of the highest authorities who decide
          the incorporation of new codes. He has a total of 35 applied and granted patents internationally.
          He served as one of the chief architects of the Linux kernel operating system and currently works as the main coordinator of the project.
          He has authored a memoir titled, ‘Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'.
