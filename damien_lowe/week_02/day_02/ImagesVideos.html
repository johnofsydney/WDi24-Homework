        <h2>The Origins of Linux</h2>
          <p>
          Linus Torvalds, the creator of the operating system phenomenon Linux, tells the story of how he went from writing code as a graduate student
          in Helsinki in the early 1990s to becoming an icon for open source software by the end of the decade.

        <h2>TED Talks - The Mind Behind Linux | Linus Torvalds</h2>
          <p>
            Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice — first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git,
            the source code management system used by developers worldwide. In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson,
            Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life.
             "I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer," Torvalds says. "I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and
             just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in."

        <h2>Linus Torvalds Insults: Respect should be earned.</h2>
          <p>
            Linus Torvalds: “I don't respect people unless I think they deserve the respect. There are people who think that respect is something that should be given,
            and I happen to be one of the people who is perfectly happy saying no respect should be earned. And without being earned, you don't get it. It's really that simple.”
